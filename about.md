# About

## Me

I'm a Software Engineer, with an interest in Mathematics.  As a Software Engineer, I'm a late adopter of Functional Programming.
As a Mathematician, I'm a late adopter of Category Theory.

At this stage, I'm a wannabe Haskell afficianado.

## The Site

When I began learning FP, there were many suitable looking places to start. [**Learn You a Haskell for Great Good**] [lyahfgg]
was certainly a fun and engaging introduction to both FP and Haskell that managed to get across the benefits of the paradigm.

These days more and more beginner FP books are cropping up that go beyond where *Learn You a Haskell for Great Good* stops.

After reading those, however, I didn't really know where to go next with it.  There's all kinds of interesting
research going on into the area, there's a lot to learn that hasn't found its way into books yet.  So my main means of learning have
been reading blogs and sifting through research papers.  To this day I still find that even though I learn about advanced concepts,
I'm still frequently surprised by really simple concepts that I come across that are completely new to me.

So I wish to catalogue the rest of my FP (primarily Haskell) learning experience on this site and try to organise the concepts
I learn in some sort of order of increasing difficulty.

Plus it'll probably help me get some misconceptions along the way corrected.
