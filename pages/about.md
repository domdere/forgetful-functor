# About

## Me

I'm a software developer with upwards of 12 years experience now.

My interests lie in:

- Functional Programming
- Devops
- Software Architecture
- Game Development
- Mathematics
  - Group Theory
  - Category Theory
  - Game Theory
- Philosophy
- Drawing
- "Leadership"

Right now I am participating in a "20% experiment". I am working part time as a software engineer
4 days a week and using the extra day a week to pursue my own interests.

That time is divvied up between doing work for [my game studio](http://irreverentpixelfeats.com) and providing
consulting on the topics of:

- Tech Leadership
- Tech Architecture
- Tech Culture

When I say "Leadership", I don't mean that word that people use in place of "Management" so they can
feel like Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos.

My interest lies in leading teams and companies towards a vision as if employees and team members mattered,
along with the users of your platform and/or customers of your business.

I'm specifically against the kind of leadership that teach employees to eschew their self-interests like:

- Improving their working environment
- Increasing their own productivity and efficiency
- Exploring their own interests
- Etc...

To the extent where they must only care about the things CEOs and sales people care about.

The "leadership" that most people aspire to is the level where they graduate from having their
self-interests denied them to the ones doing the denying.

The difficulty in leadership lies in balancing the two, tending to your users is a must of course for any
business, but its really the bare minimum. I'm just more interested in solving the harder problem.

I also believe the answer lies in combining a diverse set of interests like Philosophy, Game Theory,
Mathematics and maybe Economics, rather than just reading all of Maxwell's books on leadership.
