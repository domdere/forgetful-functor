# Coffee Catchups

As someone who values working independently but also appreciates human contact, collaboration and
the sharing of ideas and knowledge, I want to make myself available and accessible to catchup
with people who want help on a topic I can provide advice on, who want to share something that
I can learn, or any contacts that just want to catch up and shoot the breeze.

I've had the pleasure of working with some real special people over the course of my career,
and meeting other special people at meetups and etc... I'm not the best at keeping up with people,
and I would like to make an active effort in changing that.

Otherwise I run the risk of becoming a real hermit.

My interests lie in:

- Functional Programming
- Devops
- Software Architecture
- Game Development
- Mathematics
    - Group Theory
    - Category Theory
    - Game Theory
- Philosophy
- Creative Writing
- Visual Art
    - Geek Art
    - Low Poly Art
    - Pixel Art
    - Illustration
- "Leadership"

See the [contact](/contact.html) page and use one of those channels to hit me up if you are in the
same town as me and want to catch up.
